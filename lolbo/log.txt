changes i made structurally
1. took out num_tr_resets + related code from diff_bo.py
2. merged optimize and molecule optimization into diff_bo.py
3. merged molecule objective and latent space objective into objective_new.py
4. changed objective_new.py
4. merged load_data and mol_utils into guacamol_utils.py
5. changed SELFIESDataset
6. changed BaseVAE slightly


changes i made to objective_new.py
- path_to_vae_statedict modified
- self.dim = 256 -> self.dim = 128
- vae_decode
    - changed z reshape before entering vae.sample()
- initialize_vae
    - replace original SELFIESDataset() with my SELFIESDataset()
    - replace InfoTransformerVAE() with BaseMolVAE(), passing in vocab2idx instead of dataobj
    - replace load_state_dict() with custom_load_state_dict()
- vae_forward
    - collate_fn to dataobj.get_collate_fn()


changes i made to datasets
- loading data from correct gzip
- getting vocab from selfies_vocab.json instead
- encode (taken from VAEModel.selfie_to_tokens)
- decode (taken from VAEModel.tokens_to_selfie)
- tokenize_selfies (no longer needed, just return the string because encode handles it)
- collate_fn (move collate_fn into dataset, use pad_sequence, created alternative for fixed max length of 128, squeezed first dimension to accomodate vae_forward transforms)


changes i made to vae
- forward (return generated z in out_dict)
- sample (taken from VAEModel.sample)
- custom_load_state_dict (parser for the state dict)


exact same:
- lolbo.py
- turbo.py
- utils.py
- ppgpr.py
- base.py
- guacamol_utils.py (except for path to guacamol_first_20k + removed tdc docking import and methods)
